FeOS Shared Library Template
----------------------------

This template allows you to create a FeOS shared library.

You should change the name of the EXAMPLELIB_BUILD define, which is referenced in
the Makefile and in include/example.h.

It is recommended that you copy this template to a new folder in the sdk/userlib directory,
which is where developers will copy your library to.
